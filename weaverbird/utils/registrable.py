            constructor (str): optional (default=None)
                The name of the method to use on the class to construct the object.  If this is given,
                we will use this method (which must be a ``classmethod``) instead of the default
                constructor.

                If True, overwrites any existing models registered under ``name``. Else,
                throws an error if a model is already registered under ``name``.

        # Examples
        To use this class, you would typically have a base class that inherits from ``Registrable``:
        ```python
        class Transform(Registrable):
            ...
        ```
        Then, if you want to register a subclass, you decorate it like this:
        ```python
        @Transform.register("shift-transform")
        class ShiftTransform(Transform):
            def __init__(self, param1: int, param2: str):
                ...
        ```
        Registering a class like this will let you instantiate a class from a config file, where you
        give ``"type": "shift-transform"``, and keys corresponding to the parameters of the ``__init__``
        method (note that for this to work, those parameters must have type annotations).
        If you want to have the instantiation from a config file call a method other than the
        constructor, either because you have several different construction paths that could be
        taken for the same object (as we do in ``Transform``) or because you have logic you want to
        happen before you get to the constructor, you can register a specific ``@classmethod`` as the constructor to use.
